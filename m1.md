# M1

M1 is a simple macro replacement language. It applies a definitions file to an input file.

# Definitions

```
DEFINE THING1 THING2
```

replaces all instances of THING1 with THING2

# Statements

* "statements" are converted to hex
* 'statements' are untouched
* {%,@,!]number statements are converted to hex.

## Examples

`%-2` would be converted to `FE FF FF FF` for x86 but `FF FF FF FE` for knight because x86 has their immediates in little endian order and knight has their immediates in big endian order.

the number `%0x12345678` would convert to `78 56 34 12` for x86 but be `12 34 56 78` for knight.
