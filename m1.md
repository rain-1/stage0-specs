# M1

## High level perspective

M1 is a simple macro language that supports only the barest of requirements for human creation of programs at a low level.

It provides only for definitions, bare strings, numbers, hex literal blobs and comments.

The output of M1 by definition must be in hex2 format.

## Definitions

Definitions in M1 are extremely simple and are best viewed as simple replacements.

The first definition overrides all following definitions that use the same targetting.

A simple example of definitions could be:

```
DEFINE SYS_exit 01000000
DEFINE add____%ebp,%eax 01E8
DEFINE ADD_ebp_to_eax 01E8
DEFINE SELECT TARGET
```

The restrictions on the definitions are as follows:

* no whitespace characters or quotation characters can be used
* The select and target of the definition must be a single thing

The definitions are to be applied to all following lines that exactly match the SELECT and replace them with the TARGET.

## Bare strings

As it is common to need strings in assembly and more advanced programming languages, strings are supported in the M1 specification.

However the specification only requires that bare strings need to be supported.
Which by definition is any arbitrary collection of characters that starts with " and ends with the first " found.

There is no support for escaped characters or hex characters or octal characters in bare strings.

The bare string is to be converted into a stream of hex characters that is terminated with 00 or as many 00 are required for word alignment (should one wish to simplify disassembler complexity)

## Numbers

M1 allows the user to specify numbers in the standard human preferred forms.

However the format is dictated by a simple architecture specific detail:
Does the architecture support multiple or just a single size immediate value in its immediate instructions?

In the event only a single immediate size is available, no prefix characters are required.

In the event multiple immediate sizes are available, all numbers must be prefixed by a character indicitive of its size.
Eg % (0x25),@ (0x40), or ! (0x21) depending on if the immediate is 32bits, 16bits or 8bits in length.

The encoding, order of bytes and order of bits are architecture specific and are specified in the hex1 specification.

## Hex literal blobs

In the exceptionally rare case that a stream of bytes are required in an exact order and encoding but occur exactly once and thus are not fitting of a definition, hex literal blobs provide that mechanism.

A hex literal blob is defined as a stream of characters that start with ' (0x27) and continues to the first ' (0x27) found.

The M1 specification requires the contents of the 's (0x27) to be passed without any alteration to the output.

## Comments

M1 is required to support hex0 line comments and if possible pass them without modification to the output.

Additional prefixing with additional # (0x23) or ; (0x3B) characters is allowed.
